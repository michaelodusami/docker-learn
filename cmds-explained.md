**docker run --name=base-container -ti ubuntu**

This command runs a Docker container based on the latest Ubuntu image. Let's break down the options:

* **`docker run`**: This is the core command to start a new container.
* **`--name=base-container`**: This assigns the name "base-container" to the container, making it easier to manage and refer to later.
* **`-ti`**: This is a combination of two flags:
    * **`-t`** (or **`--tty`**): Allocates a pseudo-TTY connected to the container's standard input, allowing you to interact with it as if you were logged in directly.
    * **`-i`** (or **`--interactive`**): Keeps STDIN open even if not attached, which is necessary for interactive sessions.
* **`ubuntu`**:  This specifies the image to use. In this case, it's the official Ubuntu image from Docker Hub. Since no tag is specified, it defaults to the `latest` tag.
