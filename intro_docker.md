# Introduction to Docker

Docker is like a magical box for your apps! It lets you package your application with everything it needs to run, so it can work on any computer, regardless of its setup.

Think of it like this:

* You have a recipe (your app's code).
* Docker provides a complete kitchen (all the tools and ingredients your app needs).
* You put the recipe and kitchen in a container (a Docker image).
* Now you can take this container to any kitchen in the world (any computer) and cook your dish (run your app) without worrying if they have the right ingredients or tools.

This makes it super easy to move apps between computers, test them, and update them without messing anything up.
