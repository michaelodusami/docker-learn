**What is a Docker image in normal terms?**

Imagine a master template or blueprint for creating a Docker container. It contains everything needed to run an application: the code, the runtime environment (like libraries and dependencies), and any necessary configurations. This template is read-only, meaning it can't be changed once created. This "template" is a Docker image.

**What is a Docker image explained simply?**

It's like a snapshot of your application and its environment, frozen in time. You can use this snapshot to create multiple identical containers.

**Example:**

Think of a cake recipe. The recipe itself is the Docker image. It contains all the ingredients and instructions for baking the cake. When you follow the recipe, you create a cake (the Docker container) based on that image.

**Common terms around images:**

* **Layers:** Docker images are built in layers, where each layer represents a change to the image. This makes them efficient to store and transfer.
* **Base image:** An existing image that serves as the foundation for a new image. For example, you might use an `ubuntu` base image and add your application code on top of it.
* **Dockerfile:** A text file with instructions for building a Docker image. It's like the list of steps in your cake recipe.
* **Docker Hub:** A public registry where you can find and share Docker images. It's like a cookbook with many cake recipes.
* **Tag:** A label used to identify different versions of an image (e.g., `ubuntu:latest`, `python:3.9`).

**Common commands around images and what they mean (including tags):**

* `docker build -t [image_name:tag] .`: Builds an image from a Dockerfile.
    * `-t`: Specifies the image name and tag (e.g., `my-app:latest`).
* `docker images`: Lists all images stored locally.
* `docker pull [image_name:tag]`: Pulls an image from a registry (like Docker Hub).
* `docker push [image_name:tag]`: Pushes an image to a registry.
* `docker rmi [image_name:tag]`: Removes an image from your local machine.

**Tags:**

Tags are essential for versioning your images. They help you differentiate between different versions of the same application or environment (e.g., `my-app:v1`, `my-app:v2`). The `latest` tag is automatically applied if you don't specify a tag and refers to the most recent version of the image.

### Explanation of Image Layers

**Image Layers** are the building blocks of container images, each representing a set of changes to the filesystem. These layers are immutable, meaning once created, they cannot be changed. Layers allow for modularity, reusability, and efficient storage of containerized applications.

1. **Composition of Layers**:
   - Each layer contains specific filesystem changes such as added files, deleted files, or modified files.
   - For example:
     - The first layer might include a base operating system and a package manager.
     - Subsequent layers may add application dependencies, configuration files, or application source code.

2. **Reusability**:
   - Layers are shared between images, allowing multiple images to leverage common layers (e.g., a Python runtime).
   - This reduces storage, speeds up image builds, and optimizes bandwidth when distributing images.

3. **Execution with Layers**:
   - When an image is run as a container, its layers are combined using a **union filesystem**, creating a single, unified view of the filesystem.
   - The container can make changes, but these changes are stored in a writable directory unique to that container, preserving the immutability of the original layers.

### Example of Image Layers

#### Theoretical Example of Layers:
1. **Layer 1**: Adds basic commands and a package manager (e.g., `apt`).
2. **Layer 2**: Installs a Python runtime and `pip` for managing dependencies.
3. **Layer 3**: Adds the application's `requirements.txt` file.
4. **Layer 4**: Installs dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
5. **Layer 5**: Copies the application's source code.

#### Visualization:
- **Layer 1**: [Base Image + Commands]
- **Layer 2**: [Python Runtime]
- **Layer 3**: [Requirements.txt]
- **Layer 4**: [Dependencies Installed]
- **Layer 5**: [Application Source Code]

If another image needs Python, Layers 1 and 2 can be reused.

### Summary

Container images consist of **immutable layers** representing filesystem changes. Layers are stacked together using a **union filesystem** when a container runs. They enable modular development, efficient storage, and reusability. Changes made during container runtime are stored separately from the base image layers, ensuring multiple containers can share the same base.

### Real-World Example

Imagine you want to containerize a Python web application:

1. Start with a base image (e.g., Ubuntu).
2. Install Python and dependencies (e.g., Flask, SQLAlchemy).
3. Copy the app's code and configuration files.
4. Build the image.

If you later want to create another Python app, you can reuse the same Python and dependencies layer, only adding app-specific files.
