**What is a Docker image in normal terms?**

Imagine a master template or blueprint for creating a Docker container. It contains everything needed to run an application: the code, the runtime environment (like libraries and dependencies), and any necessary configurations. This template is read-only, meaning it can't be changed once created. This "template" is a Docker image.

**What is a Docker image explained simply?**

It's like a snapshot of your application and its environment, frozen in time. You can use this snapshot to create multiple identical containers.

**Example:**

Think of a cake recipe. The recipe itself is the Docker image. It contains all the ingredients and instructions for baking the cake. When you follow the recipe, you create a cake (the Docker container) based on that image.

**Common terms around images:**

* **Layers:** Docker images are built in layers, where each layer represents a change to the image. This makes them efficient to store and transfer.
* **Base image:** An existing image that serves as the foundation for a new image. For example, you might use an `ubuntu` base image and add your application code on top of it.
* **Dockerfile:** A text file with instructions for building a Docker image. It's like the list of steps in your cake recipe.
* **Docker Hub:** A public registry where you can find and share Docker images. It's like a cookbook with many cake recipes.
* **Tag:** A label used to identify different versions of an image (e.g., `ubuntu:latest`, `python:3.9`).

**Common commands around images and what they mean (including tags):**

* `docker build -t [image_name:tag] .`: Builds an image from a Dockerfile.
    * `-t`: Specifies the image name and tag (e.g., `my-app:latest`).
* `docker images`: Lists all images stored locally.
* `docker pull [image_name:tag]`: Pulls an image from a registry (like Docker Hub).
* `docker push [image_name:tag]`: Pushes an image to a registry.
* `docker rmi [image_name:tag]`: Removes an image from your local machine.

**Tags:**

Tags are essential for versioning your images. They help you differentiate between different versions of the same application or environment (e.g., `my-app:v1`, `my-app:v2`). The `latest` tag is automatically applied if you don't specify a tag and refers to the most recent version of the image.
