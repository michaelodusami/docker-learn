**What is a Docker container in normal terms?**

Imagine a lightweight, portable box that holds everything your application needs to run: the code, the tools (like libraries and dependencies), and the settings. This box ensures your app runs the same way, no matter where you put it (your laptop, a server in the cloud, etc.). This "box" is a Docker container.

**What is a Docker container explained simply?**

It's like a magic box for your app, ensuring it works consistently anywhere, like a video game that runs the same on any console.

**Example:**

Think of a web server like Apache.  Instead of installing Apache directly on your computer, you can use a Docker container that has Apache pre-installed and configured. This container can be easily moved to another computer without worrying about compatibility issues.

**Common terms around containers:**

* **Image:** A read-only template used to create a container. It's like a blueprint for your app's environment.
* **Container:** A running instance of an image. It's like a live version of your app, running in its isolated environment.
* **Dockerfile:** A text file with instructions for building a Docker image. It's like a recipe for creating your app's environment.
* **Docker Hub:** A public registry where you can find and share Docker images. It's like a library of pre-built app environments.
* **Volume:** A way to persist data generated by and used by Docker containers. It's like a separate storage space for your app's data.

**Common commands around containers and what they mean (including tags):**

* `docker run [image_name:tag]`: Creates and starts a container from an image.
    * `-d`: Runs the container in detached mode (in the background).
    * `-p [host_port]:[container_port]`: Maps a port on the host machine to a port on the container.
    * `--name [container_name]`: Assigns a name to the container.
* `docker ps`: Lists running containers.
    * `-a`: Lists all containers (running and stopped).
* `docker stop [container_name/ID]`: Stops a running container.
* `docker start [container_name/ID]`: Starts a stopped container.
* `docker rm [container_name/ID]`: Removes a container.
* `docker build -t [image_name:tag] .`: Builds an image from a Dockerfile.
* `docker push [image_name:tag]`: Pushes an image to a registry (like Docker Hub).
* `docker pull [image_name:tag]`: Pulls an image from a registry.

**Tags:**

Tags are used to identify different versions of an image (e.g., `ubuntu:latest`, `nginx:1.23`).  The `latest` tag usually refers to the most recent version of the image.
